    "### Entity Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity resolution, also known as record deduplication, is the process of identifying rows in one or more data sets that refer to the same real world entity.\n",
    "Take an example.\n",
    "You're on ebay looking for a [hip data science accessory][sliderulewiki], but you're on a budget, so you decide to scrape the [ebay listings][ebay] for a few days to get a feel for the market.\n",
    "Unfortunately, the listings are confusing and you don't know how to aggregate them.\n",
    "Entity resolution to the rescue!\n",
    "You find an [authoritative database][sliderules] and map all the ebay listings to it.\n",
    "Now you can comparison shop, get that sweet Keuffel and Esser for way cheap, and impress all the data hipsters.\n",
    "\n",
    "But finding matching records is a hard problem in general.\n",
    "A major reason is that the criteria for identifying duplicates are often vague and impossible to encode in rules.\n",
    "In addition, from a purely computational perspective, the problem is quadratic in the size of its inputs: naively, all pairs of records need to be compared to find all the duplicates.\n",
    "In this assignment, we will begin to address both these challenges.\n",

We call these weights `local` weights.  TF is an example of a local weight, because it depends on the length of the source.  On the other hand, some token weights only depend on the token, and are the same everywhere that token is found.  We call these weights `global`, and IDF is one such weight.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to do text comparisons in a formal way.\n",
    "The metric of string distance we will use is called **cosine similarity**.\n",
    "We will treat each document as a vector in some high dimensional space.\n",
    "Then, to compare two documents we compute the cosine of the angle between their two document vectors.\n",
    "This is easier than it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question to answer is how do we represent documents as vectors?\n",
    "The answer is familiar: bag-of-words!\n",
    "We treat each unique token as a dimension, and treat token weights as magnitudes in their respective token dimensions.\n",
    "For example, suppose we use simple counts as weights, and we want to interpret the string \"Hello, world!  Goodbye, world!\" as a vector.\n",
    "Then in the \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" dimensions the vector has value 1, in the \"world\" dimension it has value 2, and it is zero in all other dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next question is: given two vectors how do we find the cosine of the angle between them?\n",
